# GraphDiagonalizability-Proto
When designing quantum computers, we use undirected, potentially weighted graphs to represent networks of quantum processors. Such a graph is called “_S_-diagonalizable” if its discrete Laplacian is diagonalizable by some matrix _P_ with all entries from _S_ ⊆ __R__, and it is said to have an “_S_-bandwidth” of _k_ if _P_<sup>T</sup>_P_ has matrix bandwidth _k_. It has recently been shown that low {-1,1}- and {-1,0,1}-bandwidths are in many cases indicators of “perfect state transfer”—the reliable transmission of quantum bits, or qubits, between separate nodes. We herein present the first algorithm to determine the minimum {-1,1}- and {-1,0,1}-bandwidths of a given graph in the hopes of advancing the development of quantum information hardware. Particular emphasis is placed on testing for “weak Hadamard diagonalizability,” where a weak Hadamard matrix is some {-1,0,1}-matrix _W_ such that _W_<sup>T</sup>_W_ is tridiagonal. Finally, we set forth test results on select unweighted graphs up to order 14 and detail findings on edge weightings (which correspond to different voltages in a quantum circuit) that may induce {-1,1}- and {-1,0,1}-diagonalizability.
